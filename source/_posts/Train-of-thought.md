Finally adding a post, after ~3 months of having this blog up.

I'm not sure what to throw out here.

No one is going to see it, but they could so I don't want this to get too personal.

Some ideas I am throwing around in my head:

``` bash
- A flood of my terrible opinions on tabletop RPGs, running games and game design
- Dry industry news and domain knowledge I pick up during my career
- My goals and personal projects
```

Personal projects seems the most likely. This is the first, but hopefully not the last.

I want to do some cool stuff before I kick the bucket.
